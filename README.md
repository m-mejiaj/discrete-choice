# How much airlines passengers are willing to pay in the USA: estimation of a discrete choice model

This case study is based in a discrete choice experiment conducted originally by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the United States in 2004 and reported on the paper on the Journal of Revenue and Price Management (Garrow, Jones, & Parker, 2007).

The goal with this stated preference experiment is to determine how sensitive air passengers are to various attributes of an airline itinerary, including fare, travel time, transfers, and legroom. The survey was designed with the help of Jordan Louviere of the University of Technology, Sydney.

The survey was administered to customers of an Internet airline booking service that searches for low-cost travel deals. While waiting for the search engine to return real itineraries for their requested travel, randomly selected customers were asked to complete a survey customized to their origin and destination.

Overall, the experiment aimed to gather data on consumer preferences and decision-making processes regarding air travel. The results could be used to inform marketing strategies for airlines, improve the design of flight itineraries, and provide insights into consumer behavior in the air travel industry.
